<h1>Contract of Services</h1>

<h2>Introductions and Definitions</h2>

<p>This is an agreement between Mr. Harrison Brown ("I" or "me") and [Insert Company’s Name] ("you").</p>

<p>This agreement will be in accordance with the following Terms and Conditions until an alternative is specifically upon agreed between the parties.</p>

<h3>Purpose of the Agreement</h3>

<p>The details of the agreement are that you are hiring me to [design and develop a website].</p>

<h3>Commencement of the Agreement</h3>

<p>The agreement will commence on [date] and is to be carried out in accordance with the terms set out.</p>

<p>It can be terminated by either party provided a calendar months' notice is provided in writing. The agreement will be terminated immediately if the agreement is breached by either party. If [company] go into liquidation or administration, the contract will be terminated immediately. </p>

<h3>Fee for Services</h3>

<p>The services will be carried out for the total estimated price of [insert price].</p>

<p>The final price is to be paid upon completion of the services provided. Work I do will not be released to you until final payment has cleared. All payments must be made in GBP (£).</p>

<h4>Deposit</h4>

<p>A deposit of [insert price] is required before the commencement of any services. Services shall not begin until the deposit has been received. If the initial deposit is not paid promptly I reserve the right to re-define the completion date(s) to fairly reflect the delay caused by late payment of the deposit.</p>

<h4>Late payments</h4>

<p>You agree to pay all invoices within 7 days of receipt, unless the invoice specifies otherwise. Delinquent bills will be assessed a 5% charge if payment has not cleared within 7 days of the due date as shown on the invoice. If any amount continues to remain unpaid after this an addition 5% of the original invoice will be charged for every 7 days of delinquency. In the case that collection by a 3rd party becomes necessary you agree to pay all fees incurred by that process.</p>

<p>If any payments are not paid within 31 days of their due date I reserve the right to commence legal proceedings to retrieve the outstanding balance.</p>

<h4>Changes to price</h4>

<p>If during the course of this contract new information is discovered or given to me that would have significantly altered my original price estimate you agree either to change parts of the Scope Of Work or to increase the price for the agreed services. </p>

<h4>Hourly rate</h4>

<p>Where this contract refers to an hourly rate, that rate shall be £100 per hour.</p>

<h4>Cancellation fee</h4>

<p>In the event that you choose to cancel this contract for any reason you agree to pay me in full for any services I have completed up to that point, plus a cancellation fee of 25% of the price of this contract, the total amount of which shall not exceed the total price of this contract. Unless the Scope Of Work has been broken down into individually priced sections the price of completed services will be assessed at the hourly rate. In the event of cancellation copyright for all elements that I have created or worked on remains with me.</p>

<h3>Expectations of Parties</h3>

<p><em>You:</em> You confirm that you have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You also confirm that you have made efforts to set-aside the time required to work with me through the course of this contract and have the financial capacity to pay according to the agreed payment schedule. You agree to provide everything I need to complete the project in adequate time and in the format I request. You will review my work and provide feedback and approval in a timely manner. Deadlines apply to both parties, so you will be bound by the dates we have agreed. If work or tasks that I assign to you during the course of this contract are not completed by the agreed deadline for that work – or if we cannot agree on a feasible deadline because of your availability – you will be responsible for any missed final deadlines, in which case you may have to pay additional costs for me to complete the agreed work. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.</p>

<p><em>Me:</em> I have the experience and ability to do everything I've agreed with you and will do it all in a professional and timely manner. I will endeavour to meet every deadline that has been set and to maintain the confidentiality of everything you've given to me for this project. Where possible and in agreement with you I will do my best to accommodate new information in a way that does not impact the schedule or cost of this contract.</p>

<h4>Process &amp; partnership</h4>

<p>By entering into this contract you and I are agreeing to work in partnership; I will not be able to make this project successful on my own and you and I take joint responsibility for the success of the project. I will perform the work agreed on to the best of my ability. To allow me to do that you agree: to make yourself and any other important members of your organisation available for regular communication with me; to take responsibility for and complete any work that is assigned to you through the course of this contract; to be forthcoming with information that is pertinent to the work we are doing; to provide useful, timely feedback to work at various stages of completion.</p>

<h4>Single point of contact</h4>

<p>Unless otherwise specified or agreed by me after the start of this contract you will be the single point of contact between me and you, or the organisation you represent. During the course of this contract I will most likely work directly with others in your organisation. However, I retain the right to require that certain decisions are made or conversations carried out by you if I deem that the input of others in your organisation is impeding my ability to work effectively. </p>

<h2>Outline of work</h2>

If the work is not able to be completed by the agreed completion date, the agreement will be immediately terminated you agree to pay me for services completed up to that point.

<p>I create designs predominantly using HTML and CSS. I will not mock-up every page of your site as a static visual picture, but I may uses sketches (digital or otherwise) and other design tools such as style-boards to help the design process.</p>

<p>You will be given opportunities to review the work and provide feedback. If, at any stage, you are is not happy with the design whilst in development, you agree to pay in full for any services I have provided up until the point of termination. The contract can be terminated once the payment has been made. </p>

<h3>Photographs and graphics</h3>

<p>You should supply graphic files in an editable, digital format. Photographs must be supplied in a high resolution digital format. Graphic files should be supplied by email where possible. Graphic files and photographs should be provided as organised, individual files. They should not be provided in other formats such as embedded in Word files. </p>

<p>If you choose to purchase stock photographs I can suggest stock libraries but you agree to search for and purchase the photos yourself. If you'd like me to search for photographs for you I can provide a separate estimate specifically for this.</p>

<p>Where large numbers of graphic files need to be provided (such as for an image gallery or catalogue of products) these files must be supplied in a clear and organised way. Time I spend deciding where and how you intended graphics to be used will be billed at the hourly rate. If you are in any doubt as to the best way to provide me with graphic files you should ask first.</p>

<h3>HTML, CSS and Javascript</h3>

<p>I deliver websites developed from HTML5 markup, CSS2.1 + 3 stylesheets for styling and unobtrusive Javascript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviours.</p>

<h3>Browser testing</h3>

<p>Browser testing will undertaken for this project. However, browser testing does not mean ensuring a website looks the same in browsers or devices of different capabilities. Rather, it means ensuring that a person's experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of their browser or device.</p>

<h3>Desktop browser testing</h3>

<p>I will test my work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla (Firefox) and Opera. Testing will also be carried out to ensure Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 &amp; 8 for Windows get an appropriate (although possibly different) experience. </p>

<p>Older browsers will not be tested unless specified in the Outline Of Work. If you require an enhanced design for older browsers I can provide a separate estimate.</p>

<h3>Search engine optimisation</h3>

<p>I build websites in a way that allows them to be accessed and read by search engines. However, unless otherwise specified in the scope of work my services will not include any activities designed to directly impact a website's ranking on search engines such as Google. I do warrant that a website I work on will gain, loose or retain ranking in search engines.</p>

<h3>Technical support and associated services</h3>

<p>This contract does not include website hosting, domain name registration, email or other related services, unless these services are specifically detailed in the Outline Of Work. This contract does not include setting up a website on any existing web hosting infrastructure or services you may have, unless this service is specifically detailed in the Outline of Work.</p>

<p>If web hosting or related services are required, or assistance is required to set up the website on your existing web hosting infrastructure or services, a separate estimate can be provided.</p>

<h3>Changes and revisions</h3>

<p>The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the estimated amount of work required to accomplish all the services defined in this contract.</p>

<p>Changes and revisions can be made to the work during the course of this contract, although this may affect the estimated price if you request complex changes or a large number of changes. I will give keep you informed of the progress of the project and will give fair warning if any requests you make are likely to cause the project to require a longer time-frame or larger budget than defined in this contract. </p>

<p>If changes and revisions you request cannot be accommodated in the current Scope Of Work you and I will discuss how to move forward. This will either be by redefining the Scope Of Work at the same price or by increasing the time-frame and/or budget required to complete the work. Work will halt while this is discussed and agreed on, after which work will continue. If work is halted for more than 3 weeks for this reason, I reserve to terminate this contract and you agree to pay for any services I have provided up until that point. However, I will do my best to ensure that you and I can quickly agree on a revised Scope Of Work and/or budget if needed and continue with the project with the least disruption possible.</p>

<p>It should be noted that fixed price contracts can sometimes be detrimental, limiting clients to their earliest ideas and not allowing experimentation or learning during a project. I would like to be flexible and can be accommodating if you would like to change or add to the Scope Of Work. A separate estimate can be given for the extra work required to fulfil your requests.</p>

<h3>Legal notices</h3>

<p>All work will be completed to the highest standard possible. However, I cannot guarantee that the work will be error-free and therefore cannot be liable to you or to any third-party for damages including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if I have been advised of them. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the webpages and website is with you.</p>

<p>If any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

<p>This contract is not transferable to third parties without my consent. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in place.</p>

<p>This is a legal document under the exclusive jurisdiction of English courts. If any provisions are breached, I reserve the right to commence legal proceedings, if required. </p>
