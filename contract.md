## Service details

### Design
I create designs predominantly using HTML and CSS. I will not mock-up every page of your site as a static visual picture, but I may uses sketches (digital or otherwise) and other design tools such as style-boards to help the design process.

You will be given opportunities to review the work and provide feedback. If, at any stage, you are is not happy with the design whilst in development, you agree to pay in full for any services I have provided up until the point of termination. The contract can be terminated once the payment has been made. 

### Text content
I am not responsible for writing or entering any text copy. If this a requirement, a separate estimate can be provided.

### Photographs and graphics
You should supply graphic files in an editable, digital format. Photographs must be supplied in a high resolution digital format. Graphic files should be supplied by email where possible. Graphic files and photographs should be provided as organised, individual files. They should not be provided in other formats such as embedded in Word files. 

If you choose to purchase stock photographs I can suggest stock libraries but you agree to search for and purchase the photos yourself. If you'd like me to search for photographs for you I can provide a separate estimate specifically for this.

Where large numbers of graphic files need to be provided (such as for an image gallery or catalogue of products) these files must be supplied in a clear and organised way. Time I spend deciding where and how you intended graphics to be used will be billed at the hourly rate. If you are in any doubt as to the best way to provide me with graphic files you should ask first.

#### HTML, CSS and Javascript
I deliver websites developed from HTML5 markup, CSS2.1 + 3 stylesheets for styling and unobtrusive Javascript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviours.

### Browser testing
Browser testing will undertaken for this project. However, browser testing does not mean ensuring a website looks the same in browsers or devices of different capabilities. Rather, it means ensuring that a person's experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of their browser or device.

### Desktop browser testing
I will test my work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla (Firefox) and Opera. Testing will also be carried out to ensure Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 & 8 for Windows get an appropriate (although possibly different) experience. 

Older browsers will not be tested unless specified in the Outline Of Work. If you require an enhanced design for older browsers I can provide a separate estimate.

### Technical support and associated services
This contract does not include website hosting, domain name registration, email or other related services, unless these services are specifically detailed in the Outline Of Work. This contract does not include setting up a website on any existing web hosting infrastructure or services you may have, unless this service is specifically detailed in the Outline of Work.

If web hosting or related services are required, or assistance is required to set up the website on your existing web hosting infrastructure or services, a separate estimate can be provided.

### Changes and revisions
The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the estimated amount of work required to accomplish all the services defined in this contract.

Changes and revisions can be made to the work during the project, although this may affect the estimated price if you request complex changes or a large number of changes. I will give keep you informed of the progress of the project and will give fair warning if any requests you make are likely to cause the project to require a longer time-frame or larger budget than defined in this contract. 

If changes and revisions you request cannot be accommodated in the current Scope Of Work you and I will discuss how to move forward. This will either be by redefining the scope of work at the same price or by increasing the time-frame and/or budget required to complete the work. Work will halt while this is discussed and agreed on, after which work will continue. If work is halted for more than 3 weeks for this reason, I reserve to terminate this contract and you agree to pay for any services I have provided up until that point. However, I will do my best to ensure that you and I can quickly agree on a revised scope and/or budget if needed and continue with the project with the least disruption possible.

It should be noted that fixed price contracts can sometimes be detrimental, limiting clients to their earliest ideas and not allowing experimentation or learning during a project. I would like to be flexible and can be accommodating if you would like to change or add to the scope of work. A separate estimate can be given for the extra work required to fulfil your requests.

### Legal notices
All work will be completed to the highest standard possible. However, I cannot guarantee that the work will be error-free and therefore cannot be liable to you or to any third-party for damages including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if I have been advised of them. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the webpages and website is with you.

If any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

This contract is not transferable to third parties without my consent. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in place.

This is a legal document under the exclusive jurisdiction of English courts. If any provisions are breached, I reserve the right to commence legal proceedings, if required. 

### Laws affecting electronic commerce
