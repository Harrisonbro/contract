# Contract of work

Between me (Harrison Brown) and you ([customer name]).

## Summary
I will always do my best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it's important to have things written down so we both know what's been agreed, who should do what and when and what will happen if something should go wrong.

So, in short:

You ([customer name, possibly 'on behalf of ...']), located at [customer address] are hiring me (Harrison Brown) to [design and develop a website] for the estimated total price of [total] as outlined in our previous correspondence.

## What do both parties agree to do?
_You_: You confirm that you have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You'll give me everything I need to complete the project as and when, and in the format I need it. You'll review my work and provide feedback and approval in a timely manner. Deadlines apply to both parties, so you'll also be bound by the dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.

_Me_: I have the experience and ability to do everything I've agreed with you and I'll do it all in a professional and timely manner. I'll endeavour to meet every deadline that we've set and I'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give to me for this project.

## Outline of work
[what work is included in this contract, and what dates?]

### Completion date
We agree to complete the work outlined above by [completion date]

## The details

### Design
I create designs predominantly using HTML and CSS, and will not mock-up every page of your site as a static visual picture. I also use sketches (digital or otherwise) and other design tools such as style-boards to help the design process.

You will be given opportunities to review my work and provide feedback. If, at any stage, you're not happy with the direction my work is taking you will pay me in full for everything that I've produced until that point and may then cancel this contract.

### Text content
I am not responsible for writing or entering any text copy. If you would like to hire me to create content or enter large amounts of text into your website we can draw up a separate agreement for that.

### Photographs and graphics
You should supply graphic files in an editable, digital format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. Graphic files should be supplied by email where possible. Graphic files and photographs should be provided as organised, individual files (and not in other formats such as embedded in Word files).

Where large numbers of graphics files need to be provided to me (such as for an image gallery or catalogue of products) these files must be supplied in an clear, organised way. Time spent figuring out which graphics should go where will be billed at the hourly rate.

### HTML, CSS and Javascript
I deliver websites developed from HTML5 markup, CSS2.1 + 3 stylesheets for styling and unobtrusive Javascript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviours.

### Browser testing
Browser test does not mean ensuring a website looks the same in browsers or devices of different capabilities. It does mean ensuring that a person's experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of their browser or device.

### Desktop browser testing
I test my work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. I'll also test to ensure Microsft Internet Explorer 7 & 8 for Windows get an appropriate (although possibly different) experience. I will not test in older browsers unless you specify otherwise. If you need an enhanced design for older browsers I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Technical support and associated services
This contract does not include website hosting, domain name registration, email or other related services. This contract does not include setting up a website on any existing web hosting infrastructure or services you may have.

If you need web hosting or related services, or need me to set up your website on your existing web hosting infrastructure or services, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Changes and revisions
Fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you as they often limit you to your earliest ideas and don't allow for experimentation or learning during the project. I don't want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the amount of work I estimate will be needed to accomplish everything you've told me you want to achieve, but I'm happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new it won't be a problem as I can provide a separate estimate for that. Please note, however, that a large number of small changes can add a lot of extra work which we will need to agree a separate estimate for.

### Legal stuff
I can't guarantee that my work will be error-free and therefore cannot be liable to you or to any third-party for damages including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you've advised me of them. 

Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

### Laws affecting electronic commerce
Governments sometimes enact laws and levy taxes affecting Internet electronic commerce. You will take full responsibility for complying with such laws, taxes and tariffs and will hold

### Copyrights
First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by you, or that you have permission to use them.

After your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You'll own the visual elements that I create for this project. I'll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as I am not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.

I will own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and I will license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only.

I love to show off my work and share what I've learned with other people, so I reserve the right to display and link to your project as part of my portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.

### Payments
I'm sure you will understand how important it is to a small business such as mine that you pay the invoices I send you promptly.

You agree to stick to the following payment schedule:

[payment schedule]

### Miscellaneous
You may not transfer this contract to anyone else without my permission. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

Although the language used in this contract is simple its intent is serious. It is a legal document under the exclusive jurisdiction of English courts.
